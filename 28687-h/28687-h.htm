women, who never had chick nor child of their own, but who always know

be laid aside for more learned books, such as <i>they</i> could select

deface my beauties, nor their wise pratings equal my wiser prattlings;

<h4>COTTON MATHER AND MOTHER GOOSE.</h4>

<div class = "intro">
<p><i>Mr. Editor</i>:&mdash;Your correspondent, N.B.S., has so
decisively given a <i>quietus</i> to the question as to the birthplace
of Cotton Mather, that there is no danger of its ever being revived
again. But there is another question of equal importance to many, to the
literary world in particular, which should in like manner be put to
rest. <i>Who was Mother Goose?</i> and <i>when</i> were her melodies
first given to the world? These are questions which have been often
asked, but have never been satisfactorily answered. The recent
publication of a book called “Mother Goose for Old Folks” has again
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
revived these questions, which serves to show that the subject has not
yet lost its interest.</p>

<p>Many persons imagine that Mother Goose is a myth,&mdash;that no such
person ever existed. This is a mistake. <i>Mother Goose</i> was not only
a veritable personage, but was born and resided many years in Boston,
where many of her descendants may now be found. The last that bore the
ancient paternal cognomen died about the year 1807, and was buried in
the Old Granary Burying Ground, where probably lie the remains of the
whole blood, if we may judge from the numerous grave-stones which mark
their resting place. The family originated in England, but at what time
they came to this country is unknown,&mdash;but probably about the year
1656. This was the “<i>Wealthy family of Goose</i>” which is
immortalized by Mr. Bowditch in his book of Suffolk Names, who at the
same time has immortalized
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
himself. They were landholders in Boston, so early as 1660. Nearly half
the space between West and Winter streets, on Washington street, and
extending westerly towards Tremont street, 275 feet belonged to this
family, as did also a large tract of land on Essex, Rowe and Bedford
streets, upon which now stand two churches and a large number of
dwelling houses. <i>So much for Mother Goose.</i> Now for her
melodies.</p>

<p>It is well known to antiquarians that more than <i>two</i> hundred
years ago there was a small book in circulation in London bearing the
name of “Rhymes for the nursery; or Lulla-Byes for Children,” which
contained <i>many of the identical pieces</i> which have been handed
down to us and now form part of the “Mother Goose’s Melodies” of the
present day. It contained also other pieces much more silly, if
possible, and some that the <i>American</i> types of
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
the present day would refuse to give off an impression. The “cuts” or
illustrations thereof were of the coarsest description.</p>

<p>The first book of the kind known to be printed in this country bears
the title of “<i>Songs for the Nursery; or, Mother Goose’s Melodies</i>
for Children.” Something probably intended to represent a goose with a
very long neck and mouth wide open, covered a large part of the title
page, at the bottom of which, Printed by T.&nbsp;Fleet, at his printing
house, Pudding lane, 1719. Price, two coppers. Several pages were
missing, so that the whole number could not be ascertained.</p>

<p>This T. Fleet, according to Isaiah Thomas, was a man of considerable
talent and of great wit and humor. He was born in England, and was
brought up in a printing office in the city of Bristol, where he
afterwards worked as a journeyman. Although he was considered a
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
man of sense, he was never thought to be overburdened with religious
sentiments; he certainly was not in his latter days. Yet he was
<i>more</i> than suspected of being actively engaged in the riotous
proceedings connected with the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, in Queen Ann’s
time. In London, Bristol, and many other places, the mobs and riots were
of a very serious nature. In London several meeting houses were sacked
and pulled down, and the materials and contents made into bonfires, and
much valuable property destroyed. Several of the rioters were arrested,
tried and convicted. The trials of some of them are now before me. How
deeply Fleet was implicated in these disturbances was never known, but
being of the same mind with Jack Falstaff, that “the better part of
valor is discretion,” thought it prudent to put the Ocean between
himself and danger. He made his way to this country and arrived
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
in Boston, 1712. Being a man of some enterprise he soon established a
printing office in Pudding lane (now Devonshire street), where he
printed small books, pamphlets, ballads, and such matter as offered.
Being industrious and prudent, he gradually accumulated property. It was
not long before he became acquainted with the “wealthy family of Goose,”
a&nbsp;branch of which he had before known in Bristol, and was shortly
married to the eldest daughter.</p>

<p>By the record of marriages in the City Registrar’s office, it appears
that in “1715, June&nbsp;8, was married by Rev. <i>Cotton Mather, Thomas
Fleet to Elizabeth Goose</i>.” The happy couple took up their residence
in the same house with the printing office in Pudding lane. In due time
their family was increased by the birth of a son and heir. Mother Goose,
like all good grandmothers, was in ecstasies at the event; her joy was
unbounded; she spent her
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
whole time in the nursery, and in wandering about the house, pouring
forth, in not the most melodious strains, the songs and ditties which
she had learned in her younger days, greatly to the annoyance of the
whole neighborhood&mdash;to Fleet in particular, who was a man fond of
quiet. It was in vain he exhausted his shafts of wit and ridicule, and
every expedient he could devise: it was of no use&mdash;the old lady was
not thus to be put down; so, like others similarly situated, he was
obliged to submit. His shrewdness, however, did not forsake him; from
this seeming evil he contrived to educe some good; he conceived the idea
of collecting the songs and ditties as they came from his mother, and
such as he could gather from other sources, and publishing them for the
benefit of the world&mdash;not forgetting himself. This he did&mdash;and
thus “<i>Mother Goose’s Melodies</i>” were brought forth.
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
The adoption of this title was in derision of his good mother-in-law,
and was perfectly characteristic of the man, as he was never known to
spare his nearest friends in his raillery, or when he could excite
laughter at their expense.</p>

<p><i>Cotton Mather and Mother Goose</i> thus stand in juxtaposition;
and as the former was instrumental in cementing the union, which
resulted in placing the latter so conspicuously before the world, it is
but just that it should be so,&mdash;although the one was a learned man,
a&nbsp;most voluminous writer, and published a great many books, some
wise and some foolish, it may well be doubted whether any one, or all of
them, together, have passed through so many editions,&mdash;been read by
so many hundreds of thousands, not to say millions,&mdash;put so many
persons to sleep, or in general done so much good to the world as the
simple melodies of the other.</p>
