HEAR WHAT MA'AM GOOSE SAYS!


My dear little Blossoms, there are now in this world, and always will
be, a great many grannies besides myself, both in petticoats and
pantaloons, some a deal younger to be sure; but all monstrous wise, and
of my own family name. These old women, who never had chick nor child of
their own, but who always know how to bring up other people's children,
will tell you with very long faces, that my enchanting, quieting,
soothing volume, my all-sufficient anodyne for cross, peevish,
won't-be-comforted little bairns, ought to be laid aside for more
learned books, such as _they_ could select and publish. Fudge! I tell
you that all their batterings can't deface my beauties, nor their wise
pratings equal my wiser prattlings; and all imitators of my refreshing
songs might as well write a new Billy Shakespeare as another Mother
Goose--we two great poets were born together, and we shall go out of the
world together.

  No, no, my Melodies will never die,
  While nurses sing, or babies cry.

HISTORY OF THE GOOSE FAMILY.

[_From the Boston Transcript._]


COTTON MATHER AND MOTHER GOOSE.

_Mr. Editor_:--Your correspondent, N.B.S., has so decisively given a
_quietus_ to the question as to the birthplace of Cotton Mather, that
there is no danger of its ever being revived again. But there is
another question of equal importance to many, to the literary world
in particular, which should in like manner be put to rest. _Who was
Mother Goose?_ and _when_ were her melodies first given to the world?
These are questions which have been often asked, but have never been
satisfactorily answered. The recent publication of a book called "Mother
Goose for Old Folks" has again revived these questions, which serves to
show that the subject has not yet lost its interest.

Many persons imagine that Mother Goose is a myth,--that no such person
ever existed. This is a mistake. _Mother Goose_ was not only a veritable
personage, but was born and resided many years in Boston, where many
of her descendants may now be found. The last that bore the ancient
paternal cognomen died about the year 1807, and was buried in the Old
Granary Burying Ground, where probably lie the remains of the whole
blood, if we may judge from the numerous grave-stones which mark their
resting place. The family originated in England, but at what time they
came to this country is unknown,--but probably about the year 1656.
This was the "_Wealthy family of Goose_" which is immortalized by
Mr. Bowditch in his book of Suffolk Names, who at the same time has
immortalized himself. They were landholders in Boston, so early as 1660.
Nearly half the space between West and Winter streets, on Washington
street, and extending westerly towards Tremont street, 275 feet belonged
to this family, as did also a large tract of land on Essex, Rowe and
Bedford streets, upon which now stand two churches and a large number of
dwelling houses. _So much for Mother Goose._ Now for her melodies.

It is well known to antiquarians that more than _two_ hundred years ago
there was a small book in circulation in London bearing the name of
"Rhymes for the nursery; or Lulla-Byes for Children," which contained
_many of the identical pieces_ which have been handed down to us and
now form part of the "Mother Goose's Melodies" of the present day. It
contained also other pieces much more silly, if possible, and some that
the _American_ types of the present day would refuse to give off an
impression. The "cuts" or illustrations thereof were of the coarsest
description.

The first book of the kind known to be printed in this country bears the
title of "_Songs for the Nursery; or, Mother Goose's Melodies_ for
Children." Something probably intended to represent a goose with a very
long neck and mouth wide open, covered a large part of the title page,
at the bottom of which, Printed by T. Fleet, at his printing house,
Pudding lane, 1719. Price, two coppers. Several pages were missing,
so that the whole number could not be ascertained.

This T. Fleet, according to Isaiah Thomas, was a man of considerable
talent and of great wit and humor. He was born in England, and was
brought up in a printing office in the city of Bristol, where he
afterwards worked as a journeyman. Although he was considered a man
of sense, he was never thought to be overburdened with religious
sentiments; he certainly was not in his latter days. Yet he was _more_
than suspected of being actively engaged in the riotous proceedings
connected with the trial of Dr. Sacheverell, in Queen Ann's time. In
London, Bristol, and many other places, the mobs and riots were of a
very serious nature. In London several meeting houses were sacked and
pulled down, and the materials and contents made into bonfires, and much
valuable property destroyed. Several of the rioters were arrested, tried
and convicted. The trials of some of them are now before me. How deeply
Fleet was implicated in these disturbances was never known, but being
of the same mind with Jack Falstaff, that "the better part of valor is
discretion," thought it prudent to put the Ocean between himself and
danger. He made his way to this country and arrived in Boston, 1712.
Being a man of some enterprise he soon established a printing office
in Pudding lane (now Devonshire street), where he printed small books,
pamphlets, ballads, and such matter as offered. Being industrious and
prudent, he gradually accumulated property. It was not long before he
became acquainted with the "wealthy family of Goose," a branch of which
he had before known in Bristol, and was shortly married to the eldest
daughter.

By the record of marriages in the City Registrar's office, it appears
that in "1715, June 8, was married by Rev. _Cotton Mather, Thomas Fleet
to Elizabeth Goose_." The happy couple took up their residence in the
same house with the printing office in Pudding lane. In due time their
family was increased by the birth of a son and heir. Mother Goose, like
all good grandmothers, was in ecstasies at the event; her joy was
unbounded; she spent her whole time in the nursery, and in wandering
about the house, pouring forth, in not the most melodious strains, the
songs and ditties which she had learned in her younger days, greatly to
the annoyance of the whole neighborhood--to Fleet in particular, who was
a man fond of quiet. It was in vain he exhausted his shafts of wit and
ridicule, and every expedient he could devise: it was of no use--the old
lady was not thus to be put down; so, like others similarly situated,
he was obliged to submit. His shrewdness, however, did not forsake him;
from this seeming evil he contrived to educe some good; he conceived the
idea of collecting the songs and ditties as they came from his mother,
and such as he could gather from other sources, and publishing them for
the benefit of the world--not forgetting himself. This he did--and thus
"_Mother Goose's Melodies_" were brought forth. The adoption of this
title was in derision of his good mother-in-law, and was perfectly
characteristic of the man, as he was never known to spare his nearest
friends in his raillery, or when he could excite laughter at their
expense.

_Cotton Mather and Mother Goose_ thus stand in juxtaposition; and as
the former was instrumental in cementing the union, which resulted in
placing the latter so conspicuously before the world, it is but just
that it should be so,--although the one was a learned man, a most
voluminous writer, and published a great many books, some wise and
some foolish, it may well be doubted whether any one, or all of them,
together, have passed through so many editions,--been read by so many
hundreds of thousands, not to say millions,--put so many persons to
sleep, or in general done so much good to the world as the simple
melodies of the other.

GOOSE'S MELODIES.

  Little boy blue, come blow your horn,
  The sheep's in the meadow, the cow's in the corn,
  What! is this the way you mind your sheep,
  Under the haycock fast asleep?

[Illustration]

    There was a mad man,
    And he had a mad wife,
  And they lived all in a mad lane!
  They had three children all at a birth,
  And they too were mad every one.
    The father was mad,
    The mother was mad,
  The children all mad beside;
  And upon a mad horse they all of them got,
  And madly away did ride.

[Illustration]

  Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
  Yes, marry have I, three bags full,
  One for my master, and one for my dame,
  And one for the little boy that lives in the lane.

       *       *       *       *       *

  To market, to market, to buy a penny bun,
  Home again, home again, market is done.

    The man in the wilderness,
        Asked me,
    How many strawberries
        Grew in the sea?
  I answered him as I thought good,
    As many red herrings
        As grew in the wood.

      Little Robin Redbreast

        And down went he;
    Down came Pussy-Cat,
      Away Robin ran,
    Says little Robin Redbreast--
      Catch me if you can.
    Little Robin Redbreast jumped upon a spade,
    Pussy-Cat jumped after him, and then he was afraid.
  Little Robin chirped and sung, and what did pussy say?
  Pussy-Cat said Mew, mew mew,--and Robin flew away.

    Sing a song of sixpence, a bag full of rye,
    Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie:
    When the pie was opened, the birds began to sing;
    And wasn't this a dainty dish to set before the king?
  The king was in the parlour, counting out his money;
  The queen was in the kitchen, eating bread and honey;
  The maid was in the garden, hanging out the clothes,
  There came a little blackbird and nipt off her nose.

[Illustration]

  Lady-bird, Lady-bird,
  Fly away home,
  Your house is on fire,
  Your children will burn.

  Or else I'll beat you till you're dead.

  The man in the moon came down too soon
      To inquire the way to Norridge;
  The man in the south, he burnt his mouth
      With eating cold plum porridge.

  When I was a little boy, I lived by myself,
  And all the bread and cheese I got I put upon a shelf;
  The rats and the mice, they made such a strife,
  I was forced to go to London to buy me a wife.
  The streets were so broad, and the lanes were so narrow.
  I was forced to bring my wife home in a wheelbarrow;
  The wheelbarrow broke, and my wife had a fall,
  And down came the wheelbarrow, wife and all.

  'Twas once upon a time, when Jenny Wren was young,
  So daintily she danced and so prettily she sung,
  Robin Redbreast lost his heart, for he was a gallant bird;
  So he doffed his hat to Jenny Wren, requesting to be heard.

  O, dearest Jenny Wren, if you will but be mine,
  You shall feed on cherry-pie and drink new currant wine,
  I'll dress you like a goldfinch or any peacock gay;
  So, dearest Jen, if you'll be mine, let us appoint the day.

  Jenny blushed behind her fan and thus declared her mind:
  Since, dearest Bob, I love you well, I take your offer kind;
  Cherry-pie is very nice and so is currant wine,
  But I must wear my plain brown gown and never go too fine.

[Illustration]

  Cushy Cow bonny, let down your milk,
  And I will give you a gown of silk,
    A gown of silk and a silver tee,
    If you'll let down your milk to me.

  Richard and Robin were two pretty men;

  And I'll follow after on little Jack Nag.

  Oh that I were where I would be!
    Then should I be where I am not;
  But where I am, there I must be,
    And where I would be I can not.

          Hiccory, diccory, dock,
      The mouse run up the clock;
  The clock struck one, and down he run,
          Hiccory, diccory, dock.

  Jacky, come give me your fiddle,
    If ever you mean to thrive.
  Nay, I'll not give my fiddle
    To any man alive.

  If I should give my fiddle,
    They'll think that I'm gone mad,
  For many a joyful day
    My fiddle and I have had.

  There was a Piper had a Cow,
    And he had naught to give her,
  He pull'd out his pipes and play'd her a tune,
    And bade the cow consider.

      The cow considered very well,
        And gave the piper a penny,
      And bade him play the other tune,
        "Corn rigs are bonny."

  Away, pretty robin, fly home to your nest,
  To make you my captive I still should like best,
    And feed you with worms and with bread:
  Your eyes are so sparkling, your feathers so soft,
  Your little wings flutter so pretty aloft,
    And your breast is all cover'd with red.

    Handy-spandy, Jacky dandy,
    Loves plum-cake and sugar candy.
    He bought some at a grocer's shop,
  And pleased away went hop, hop, hop.

  When good King Arthur ruled his land
    He was a goodly king;
  He stole three pecks of barley meal
    To make a bag-pudding.
  A bag-pudding the king did make,
    And stuff'd it well with plums;
  And in it put great lumps of fat,
    As big as my two thumbs.
  The king and queen did eat thereof,
    And noblemen beside;
  And what they could not eat that night,
    The queen next morning fried.

[Illustration]

  Rock-a-bye, baby, your cradle is green,
  Father's a nobleman, mother's a queen,
  And Betty's a lady, and wears a gold ring,
  And Johnny's a drummer, and drums for the king.

       *       *       *       *       *

    See saw, Jack-a-daw,
  Johnny shall have a new master;
  Johnny shall have but a penny a day,
  Because he can work no faster.

  About the bush, Willie, about the bee-hive,
  About the bush, Willie, I'll meet thee alive.

  We're three brethren out of Spain,
  Come to court your daughter Jane.
  My daughter Jane she is too young,
  She has no skill in a flattering tongue.
  Be she young or be she old,
  It's for her gold she must be sold,
  So fare you well, my lady gay,
  We shall return another day.

  Mistress Mary, quite contrary,
    How does your garden grow?
  With silver bells and cockle shells,
    And maidens all in a row.

  When I was a little boy, my mother kept me in,
  Now I am a great boy, and fit to serve the king;
  I can handle a musket, I can smoke a pipe,
  I can kiss a pretty girl at ten o'clock at night.

  Mary had a pretty bird,
  Feathers bright and yellow,
  Slender legs, upon my word
  He was a pretty fellow.

  The sweetest notes he always sung,
    Which much delighted Mary,
  And often where the cage was hung,
    She stood to hear Canary.

  This is the way the ladies ride,
        Prim, prim, prim;
  This is the way the gentlemen ride,
        Trim, trim, trim.
  Presently come the country-folks,
        Hobbledy gee, hobbledy gee.

  My dame has lost her shoe;
  My master's lost his fiddlestick,
  And knows not what to do.

  Tom, Tom, of Islington,
  Married a wife on Sunday,
  Bro't her home on Monday,
  Hired a house on Tuesday,
  Fed her well on Wednesday,
  Sick was she on Thursday,
  Dead was she on Friday,
  Sad was Tom on Saturday,
  To bury his wife on Sunday.

  I had a little husband no bigger than my thumb,
  I put him in a pint pot, and there I bid him drum;
  I bought a little handkerchief to wipe his little nose,
  And a pair of little garters to tie his little hose.

      As I was going to St. Ives,
      I met seven wives,
  Every wife had seven sacks,
  Every sack had seven cats,
  Every cat had seven kits.
      Kits, cats, sacks and wives,
      How many were going to St. Ives?

      Miss Jane had a bag, and a mouse was in it,
      She opened the bag, he was out in a minute;
  The Cat saw him jump, and run under the table,
  And the dog said, catch him, puss, soon as you're able.

  Cross Patch, draw the latch,
    Sit by the fire and spin;
  Take a cup, and drink it up,
    Then call your neighbours in.

    See-saw, Margery Daw,
  Sold her bed, and lay upon straw.
  Was not she a dirty slut,
  To sell her bed and lay in the dirt?

  What care I how black I be?
  Twenty pounds will marry me
  If twenty won't, forty shall,
  I'm my mother's bouncing girl.

  Milk-man, milk-man, where have you been?
  In Buttermilk channel up to my chin,
  I spilt my milk, and I spoilt my clothes,
  And got a long icicle hung to my nose.

  I like little pussy, her coat is so warm,
  And if I don't hurt her she'll do me do harm;
  So I'll not pull her tail, nor drive her away,
  But pussy and I very gently will play.

  There was an old woman
    Sold puddings and pies,
  She went to the mill,
    And the dust flew in her eyes.
  While through the streets,
  To all she meets,
    She ever cries,
    Hot Pies -- Hot Pies.

      A cow and a calf,
      An ox and a half,
  Forty good shillings and three.
    Is not that enough tocher
    For a shoemaker's daughter,
      A bonny sweet lass
      With a coal-black ee?

  The little Robin grieves
    When the snow is on the ground,
  For the trees have no leaves,
    And no berries can be found.

  The air is cold, the worms are hid,
    For Robin here what can be done?
  Let's strow around some crums of bread,
    And then he'll live till snow is gone.

    Little Jack Nory
    Told me a story
    How he tried
    Cock-horse to ride,
  Sword and scabbard by his side,
  Saddle, leaden spurs and switches,
    His pocket tight
    With cents all bright,
  Marbles, tops, puzzles, props,
  Now he's put in jacket and breeches.

  One name Jack, and the other name Jill;
  Fly away, Jack -- fly away, Jill,
  Come again, Jack -- come again, Jill.

  I'm going to help the girls
    Turn the new hay.

  Wee Willie Winkie runs through the town,
  Upstairs and downstairs in his night gown;
  Tapping at the window, crying at the lock,
  "Are the babes in their beds, for it's now ten o'clock?"
